# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a serious problem for most industries, including business corporations. In the telecom sector, where business companies must hold their customers to support their revenue, the problem is even more pressing. Churn prediction is utilized to identify the customers who will probably terminate their service or subscription. Telecom businesses may use their expectations of customer churn to implement proactively retentive approaches. Specifically, this project aims to construct a machine learning model using a dataset of telecom users to predict customer churn.

## Solution Overview
Machine learning is a good method to solve the churn prediction problem, as it looks at the past data and searching for the patterns that accompany the churn. There are several crucial steps to solve this project:

  1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
  2. Exploratory data analysis
  3. Feature selection and engineering
  4. Model selection, training, and evaluation

## Dataset Sourcing and Evaluation
### Dataset Description
The “Telecom Churn Dataset” was used by the project to extract a set of records including demographic and account information and service usage data of the customers. The used dataset is characterized by the target variable and the following features: Churn, gender, senior citizenship, partner, and dependent status, tenure, phone and internet service details, contract type, and payment method was used by the project.
